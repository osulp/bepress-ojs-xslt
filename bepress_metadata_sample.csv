<p>I have spent most of my career working in small and rural libraries. My first library job was at my hometown library: Langlois Public Library (service population: 785) on the southern Oregon coast. The experiences I had at Langlois and other rural Oregon libraries taught me two lessons that, while perhaps truisms, are nonetheless worth saying. First, serving patrons in rural areas—no matter your library type—bears similarity to larger library counterparts, but it differs in significant ways that require a shift in mindset. Second, “rural” is not some monolithic concept that comes with a defined set of needs, just as “urban” and “suburban” are not; each rural community and group of patrons is unique.</p>","<p>Buzzy Nielsen is a rural boy with a smattering of big city sensibilities.

NPR correspondent Jeff Brady visited our town during the summer of 2017 for a story highlighting rural communities in decline (Brady, 2017). We were a convenient case study. Our natural resource industry has been dying a slow and loud death for decades, our voters have notoriously voted down numerous tax levies, and Jeff Brady just happened to grow up here. Brady being a national business correspondent from Philadelphia, we were the perfect stereotype for a piece that closed with his grim statement: “Overall, the economic prospects for my hometown of Gold Beach, Oregon, look dim. Fortunately there’s always the beautiful beach, the river, and the forests to console those who still live here.” Despite the inevitable feeling of this conclusion, Brady could have asked much different questions and listened to different voices that would have resulted in a story about much more than malaise. In fact, when presented with innovative changes taking place, Brady commented to our library staff that a storyline of innovative change in its early stages would not help NPR make the point their audience wanted to hear.</p>
<p>I start with this story because librarians are extremely susceptible to the very mistake made by this NPR correspondent. We see what we want to see, and the decisions that follow (particularly in small rural communities) are more often than not rejected by the community because they do not truly address immediate needs. As for that Southern Oregon stereotype, our voters certainly fit the stereotype of being skeptical of paying taxes, but few taxpayers I have encountered are unwilling to pay taxes when the government entity in question has proven to be successful in addressing what they perceive as community needs. Working with this model, I believe Gold Beach is in the early phases of a renaissance rooted in the library’s community needs-based planning.

Rev. Stat. § 9.815). County law libraries have been around for more than a century in Oregon; however, what those libraries look like today and the depth of services or resources they offer vary dramatically statewide. In rural and small counties, especially, there may be limited (or nonexistent) resources, physical space, and staffing. Despite the challenges, many counties outside the Portland metropolitan area are striving to meet—and succeeding!—the legal information needs of both attorneys and non-attorneys through non-traditional service models, targeted outreach, staff training, and other endeavors. As a result, these libraries are helping to further “access to justice,” a national movement to ensure that everyone, regardless of economic means, has equitable access to the justice system, which includes legal protection, legal awareness, and legal counsel (United States Institute of Peace, 2009).</p>
<p>Oregon county law libraries have a long, well-established history of skillfully providing legal research information, reference assistance, and referrals to the public, lawyers and non-lawyers alike. More than ever before, small and rural county law libraries are discovering and devising innovative ways to make big impacts on their community’s legal information needs. Nevertheless, significant room remains for growth and improvement.

Denied, he lived out his days on the Colville, befriended by University of Washington professor Edmond Meany, and famously photographed by Meany’s friend, Edward Sheriff Curtis. A few short years after that Wallowa visit, living in a tipi on the Colville Reservation, Chief Joseph—Hin-mah-too-yah-lat-kekt—“died of a broken heart.” The New York Sun announced that “the most famous Indian in America” was gone.</p>
<p>In 1965, Alvin M. Josephy Jr.’s Nez Perce Indians and the Opening of the Northwest brought Joseph and the Nez Perce back to national attention. While working on that book, Josephy and his family fell in love with the Wallowa Country and bought a small ranch. Throughout his long working career, boxes of books and research material would be packed and shipped from the Josephy home in Greenwich, Connecticut to Joseph, Oregon, and then back the other way. The Josephy Library is based on material from those home libraries in Greenwich and Joseph, with special attention to Josephy’s own writings and to the history and culture of Indians and the West.</p>
<p>The library is housed in the Josephy Center for Arts and Culture on Main Street in the town of Joseph (“Joseph” and “Josephy” are only accidentally and serendipitously related). We tell the Nez Perce story—and other stories of Indian and Western history—with books and journals, guest speakers, blog posts, private conversations and presentations to local students, residents, guests, and groups from across the world.</p>","<p>Rich Wandschneider came to the Wallowa Country in 1971, after five years as a Peace Corps Volunteer and staff member in Turkey and Washington D.C. In Wallowa County, he worked for the OSU Extension Service for five years, then opened an Enterprise bookstore, the Bookloft, where he met Alvin and Betty Josephy.</p>
<p>In 1988 Alvin, Kim Stafford, Peter Sears, and Rich launched Fishtrap. Over his 20 years as director, Fishtrap brought hundreds of Oregon and Northwest writers and readers together in conferences, workshops, retreats, and residencies. The Bookloft turned 40 under owner Mary Swanson, and Fishtrap lives on under current director Shannon McNerney, still bringing the best writers in the West to Northeast Oregon.</p>
<p>In 2008, Wandschneider stepped aside as Fishtrap director to work on the library project that Alvin, who had become mentor and friend, left on his passing. In addition to the normal build-a-library tasks, the job includes exploring, promoting, and extending the work and legacy of Alvin Josephy. In 2015, longtime Josephy friend and editor Marc Jaffe and Wandschneider put together a Josephy reader for Vintage Books, The Longest Trail: Writings on American Indian History, Culture, and Politics. The book is intended to be an introduction to American Indian studies for students and for lay readers who want to understand what has been misunderstood or neglected completely in the standard narrative of American history. A library blog, workshops and talks by Indian artists and elders bring additional attention to this work.</p>
<p>Wandschneider has served on boards at Oregon Humanities, Friends of William Stafford, and the Wallowa Nez Perce Homeland project. He has written a regular column for the Wallowa County Chieftain for 30 years, and published essays and stories in High Country News, the Oregonian, Oregon Humanities Magazine, and others. Currently his most important work is raising two grandkids, now aged 17 and 18.</p>",,TRUE,2018-02-28 00:00,© 2017 Rich Wandschneider,,olaq1909,,Pacific University Libraries,1093-7374,olaq,Rich,,Wandschneider,,rich.wandschneider@gmail.com,Josephy Library of Western History and Culture,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,https://commons.pacificu.edu/olaq/vol23/iss3/10,11666537,olaq/vol23/iss3,1532623964

Around the same time, Clara Piazzola, the library’s young adult assistant, came to me to share an idea that was buzzing around her library school discussion boards. She told me about a program idea that would teach young people necessary skills to help them survive in the grownup world. Talk about a coincidence! I gave her the go ahead, and she began planning.</p>
<p>Clara came up with the name, Adulting 101, and a six-month program outline. Planning each session, we chose to invite local speakers for a few of the topics that warranted professional facilitators. Flyers were displayed in the library and mailed to local bulletin boards and radio stations. Adulting 101 was posted to the library website, social media, and electronic calendars. We reserved the room, bought snacks, and were ready to launch.</p>

The award included a six-week installation of a traveling exhibit called Thinking Money, designed to introduce basic concepts of financial literacy to teens, tweens, and young adults. The 50 libraries that received the Thinking Money grant were charged with partnering with community organizations to create at least four programs based on the exhibit’s theme.</p>
<p>Finding community partners was not at all difficult. Credit unions and financial planners were only too happy to conduct classes and give presentations, but I wanted to have at least one program that approached the topic a bit more obliquely, something that would soft-sell the benefits of good money management skills. Marion County Environmental Services turned out to be the perfect partner for this endeavor. MCES’s basic charge is to keep materials out of the waste stream. Through their innovative outreach activities, they challenge residents to reduce, reuse, and recycle. Their program director, Jessica Ramey, and I hatched a plan for a back-to-school blue jeans swap, reasoning that conservation of resources applies as much to the environment as it does to families’ wardrobes and bank accounts, and that people who would come to the library for free back-to-school clothes might not be the same people who would sign themselves up for a class on budgets or investments. Our theory was that if we could get people into the building for free jeans, they would discover the fabulous Thinking Money exhibit and perhaps learn something new.</p>","<p>Ann Scheppke has worked at Salem Public Library since 1986, primarily as a reference librarian, but more recently in Adult Services programming.

The tendency to procrastinate is so common; most of us are likely to have had the experience of writing a paper late into the night before it is due or making a last-ditch attempt to learn concepts the night before a final exam. There are many strategies for dealing with, preventing, or avoiding procrastination, but a group of students and tutors at the European University Viadrina (EUV) in Frankfurt/Oder, Germany, came up with a novel twist on the traditional all-nighter, turning it into a strategy instead of a last resort (Datig & Herkner, 2014).</p>
<p>Suggested by these students, the “Long Night Against Procrastination” originated through a Writing Center-Library collaboration at EUV, and many libraries in the U.S. and abroad have adopted the model (Landgraf, 2014). The general philosophy is that students pull the all-nighter before the last minute, getting on top of assignments and out in front of exams. The events are filled with organized study breaks, activities, food, and other incentives to participate, and they present an opportunity to build goodwill between students and library staff.</p>

<p>Wait. What? Llamas in the library? Surely not. Who would bring llamas in the library?</p>
<p>That would be me. And it’s just one of the many things I’ve learned over the years about youth programs, good, bad, and ugly. Let’s start with the good.</p>
<p>Probably number one on the adorable scale is our annual Royal Tea Party. We invite children to dress in their finest and have the chance to meet the “Queen.” The first year we did this, my mother played that part, and she relished every one of the curtsies and bows she received as the children walked down the royal red carpet. Now we have library staff who volunteer to play the part. After the greeting, everyone sits at linen-covered tables and is served juice, cheese cubes, and cookies. The cutlery is plastic, but the serving dishes are silver and china, donated by library staff for the event. There is brief entertainment: a story at the beginning and gentle recorded harp music in the background during tea. Patrons must pre-register, and we’re always full.</p>

Referred to as Takeovers, these events involve crafts, video games, Nerf games, and more—all while the library is closed. Each Takeover event is tailored to a specific age group (either tweens, teens, or adults) and people from outside that age group are not permitted in the library during the event. Takeovers are all about having fun and connecting with others and have proven to be incredibly popular; for example, registration and attendance caps are necessary for the Tween Takeovers to be sure the library can accommodate all that want to attend. This article will discuss the origin of the idea for CBCPL’s Takeovers, how these events are planned and coordinated, tips for any library interested in hosting their own Takeovers, and the ways in which these events tie into the CBCPL mission.</p>","<p>Bonnie Brzozowski is a Reference Librarian at the Corvallis-Benton County Public Library where she has worked since 2011.
